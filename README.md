I need to do a better job with this and follow a format.

talk about farming, things to add. use others as a template. 

I still need to write this, get back to coding
-------------------------
This was my first foray into Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Heroku.

I combined what I learned from these three areas:
https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/
https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3/node_js_and_express/
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1499332272
(code: https://github.com/100devs/rap-names-express)

There are a few improvements I would like to make, but I don't know yet how:

how to renew page after replacing corn with beans
how to order results by date after entry
how to remove first-entered cucumber plot (currently last)
how to default date to today instead of leaving it empty
right now the yield comes before the seedling icon, how to make it come after? When I rearranged in the form, it just printed again.
